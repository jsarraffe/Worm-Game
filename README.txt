LIST OF PEOPLE WHOME I HAVE RECEIVED HELP FROM:

Soren Richenberg: 

- Soren helped me create the the decontstructor for my Screen Class. I was initially confused on what to do,
but he remined me that you only need to delete that data that is put onto the heap, i.e wherever you use "new' to 
allocate memory.


Ali Kooshesh:

- Answered my question on piazza about the makefree() function

- I asked him if I could you a class for a Cell, instead of a tuple or a pair. He gave me some nice psquedo/ semi partial
solution to the Cell class. I chose to implment this way, because the last project made me like pounters, and 
it was the way I ulitimatly did the solution.


Guy Greenleaf:

- I started this project the day it got assigned, and spent a whole day getting caught up on curses. For some reason
I thought that it was neccesary. I asked him,   and he told me that you should just about the "data strucutres"
first, and after that it was smooth sailing until i finished the proejct.
